		<p><div class="sonnet">To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow, Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,
			To the last syllable of recorded time; And all our yesterdays have lighted fools, The way to dusty death.
			Out, out, brief candle! Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player, That struts and frets his hour upon the
			stage, And then is heard no more. It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
			Signifying nothing.
